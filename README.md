# Introduction
This repository contains my personal templates for
[Rebar3](https://www.rebar3.org).

Running `make install` will create symbolic links in
`~/.config/rebar3/templates`.

I highly suggest you fork the repository and modify templates so that they
contain exactly what you want.

# Templates
- `nm-app`: an OTP application for a library to be included in another
  application.
- `nm-gen-server`: a minimal gen_server module.
