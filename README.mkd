# Rebar3 templates

This repository contains my personal templates for
[Rebar3](https://www.rebar3.org). Installing them is as simple as creating a
symlink to all template files and directories in
`$HOME/.config/rebar3/templates`.

I highly suggest you fork the repository and modify templates so that they
contain exactly what you want.
